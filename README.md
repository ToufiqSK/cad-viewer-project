Hi, my name is Shaik Toufiq. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at SRM University AP. I have developed a basic web-based CAD viewer to visualize 3D models.

Approach
For this project, I used Node.js for the backend to handle file uploads and retrieval, and React with Three.js (React Three Fiber) for the frontend to render the 3D models.
